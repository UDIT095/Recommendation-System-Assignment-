# üéå Anime Recommendation System

## üéØ Objective
To build an anime recommendation engine using:

- **Content-Based Filtering** (genre-based similarity)
- **Collaborative Filtering** (user-user interaction)
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics like **RMSE**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**

## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Loaded datasets into pandas DataFrames.
- Removed missing genres in `anime.csv`.
- Filtered out ratings = -1 from `rating.csv`.
- Merged on `anime_id` to create a unified dataset.

### 2. Feature Extraction (Content-Based)

- Used `TfidfVectorizer` on `genre` column to create TF-IDF matrix.
- Computed **cosine similarity** between animes based on genre vectors.

### 3. Recommendation Engines

#### A. üé® Content-Based Filtering
Function: `recommend_anime_by_features(anime_name, top_n=10)`

- Computes similarity scores with all other animes.
- Recommends top `n` most similar animes based on genres.

#### B. üë• Collaborative Filtering (User-Based)
Function: `recommend_anime_cf(user_id, top_n=10)`

- Creates a user-item matrix from ratings.
- Uses `NearestNeighbors` with cosine similarity.
- Recommends top `n` anime based on ratings of similar users.

## üìä Evaluation

### ‚úÖ Content-Based Evaluation (from `Untitled.ipynb`)
- Used train-test split.
- Calculated:
  - `Precision`
  - `Recall`
  - `F1-score`

```python
precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')
```

### ‚úÖ Collaborative Filtering Evaluation (from `new try.ipynb`)
- Predicted ratings for user-anime pairs in test set.
- Used RMSE:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
rmse = mean_squared_error(actual, predicted, squared=False)
```

## ‚ùì Interview Questions

### Q1: What‚Äôs the difference between user-based and item-based CF?

| Aspect            | User-Based CF                           | Item-Based CF                           |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Similarity        | Between users                            | Between items                            |
| Use Case          | Find users like you                      | Find items similar to what you liked     |
| Performance       | Costly on large user bases               | More stable, often faster                |

---

### Q2: What is Collaborative Filtering?

**Collaborative Filtering** is a recommendation technique based on the past behavior of users. It works by:

- Finding **users** with similar preferences (user-based)
- Finding **items** that are similarly rated (item-based)
- Can be:
  - **Memory-based** (similarity matrix)
  - **Model-based** (matrix factorization, deep learning)

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a hybrid recommendation engine that uses both **content-based** (genre similarity) and **collaborative filtering** (user similarity) techniques. The evaluation strategies ensure reliability, and techniques like TF-IDF and NearestNeighbors provide robust foundations for scalable recommender systems.
